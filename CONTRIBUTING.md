## Contributor License Agreement

Before you can submit any code we need all contributors to sign a
contributor license agreement. By signing a contributor license
agreement (CLA) you're basically just attesting to the fact
that you are the author of the contribution and that you're freely
contributing it under the terms of the MIT License.

When you contribute to the rxn4chemistry project with a new pull request,
a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the
bot will comment on the pull request, including a link to accept the
agreement. The [individual CLA](./iCLA.md) document is available for review in this repo.
You can sign the agreement right away by opening an issue clicking [here](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/clabot-config/issues/new?assignees=&labels=cla-signing&template=cla-signature.yaml&title=CLA+signature).
